This repository contains a curated collection of Python scripts developed over the years as part of different projects and tasks, e.g. geoprocessing tools and spatial analysis.
The **_Geoprocessing Tools_** folder contains all scripts developed as part of the [Telecoupling Toolbox](http://telecouplingToolbox.org) project, using the ```arcpy``` package for integration with ESRI's ArcGIS software. The **_Habitat Mask_** folder contains scripts developed as part of the [Termite Dispersal Simulation](https://github.com/f-tonini/Termite-Dispersal-Simulation) project, to read, project, and manipulate a set of input feature classes in order to create a final suitable habitat mask.
